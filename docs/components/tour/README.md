# Tour

A tour is a special component that combines multiple sub-components into a series of steps.

Example:

1. User clicks on a help button which starts the tour. A modal opens in the middle of the screen with a "Next" button in it.
2. Clicking the next button opens a hotspot with a tooltip next to it. This also has a "Next" button
3. Clicking THAT next button opens yet another hotspot with another tooltip, etc, etc.
