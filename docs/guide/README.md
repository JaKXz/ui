# Introduction 

Onboardist UI is a collection of simple, single-focus components designed to be used for _onboarding_ new users into your applications.

## What is Onboarding?

Onboarding, or more properly "User Onboarding, is defined by UO advocate Sam Hulick as:

> "...the process of increasing the likelihood that new users become successful when adopting your product."

In practice, User Onboarding is the process of explaining to users how to use your application. This can be achieved many different ways: through written technical manuals and articles, how-to videos, UI enhancements built on top your app, and so on.

Onboardist UI helps you do the latter by providing pre-built user interface components that you use to highlight and explain parts of your application, progressively revealing how it works over time.
